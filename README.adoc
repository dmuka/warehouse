== Introduction

The Warehouse Application is a simple solution designed to manage warehouse operations, inventory tracking, and stock control.

== Project Architecture

=== Overview

The solution follows a clean, layered architecture with a strong emphasis on Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles. This approach ensures separation of concerns, maintainability, and scalability.

=== Architectural Layers

The application is organized into the following key layers:

==== Core Layer (Warehouse.Core)

The foundation of the application containing:

* Base abstractions (Entity, AggregateRoot, ValueObject)
* Domain event interfaces
* Type-safe ID implementations
* Common specifications
* Result patterns for error handling

==== Domain Layer (Warehouse.Domain)

Contains the business domain model with:

* Aggregates defining business entities and their behavior
* Domain services implementing complex business logic
* Repository interfaces for data access abstraction
* Domain events for cross-boundary communication

==== Application Layer (Warehouse.Application)

Orchestrates the application flow by:

* Implementing use cases through services and handlers
* Managing transactions and coordinating between layers
* Providing DTOs for data transfer between layers
* Handling cross-cutting concerns

==== Infrastructure Layer (Warehouse.Infrastructure)

Provides technical capabilities:

* Database access implementation (likely using Entity Framework Core)
* Repository implementations
* External service integrations
* Logging, caching, and other infrastructure concerns

==== Presentation Layer (Warehouse.Presentation)

Handles the user interface and API endpoints:

* ASP.NET Core controllers (Web API)
* API endpoints and models

== Design Patterns

=== Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

* *Aggregates*: Implemented through the AggregateRoot base class to enforce consistency boundaries
* *Entities*: Domain objects with identity and lifecycle
* *Value Objects*: Immutable objects without identity
* *Domain Events*: For loose coupling between aggregates and services
* *Repositories*: Abstract data access patterns

=== Repository Pattern

* Clean separation between domain logic and data access
* Defined through IRepository interface in Domain layer
* Implemented in the Infrastructure layer

=== Unit of Work Pattern

* Managed through IUnitOfWork interface
* Ensures atomic operations and transaction management

=== Specification Pattern

* Encapsulates query logic in reusable components
* Supports composable business rules

=== CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

* Separation of read and write operations
* Commands for state changes
* Queries for data retrieval

=== Result Pattern

* Explicit success/failure return types
* Structured error handling without exceptions

== Technologies

* *.NET 9.0*: Latest .NET platform
* *ASP.NET Core*: Web framework
* *Entity Framework Core*: (likely) ORM for data access
* *C# 13.0*: Programming language with latest features

== Getting Started

=== Prerequisites

* .NET 9.0 SDK
* SQL Server (or your configured database)
* Visual Studio 2022/Rider 2025 or newer
